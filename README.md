 Hand Gesture Controlled 3-D Hologram [May-July ’18]: (Institute Technical Summer Project, IIT Bombay) Designed models and animations in Unity which were then projected as holograms, incorporating features like rotation, zooming and transformations in them, Controlled these features using simple hand gestures on a self-designed IR sensor board and interfaced these two using Arduino MEGA microcontroller & Presented the final output in the form of 3-D hologram using a truncated transparent pyramid as a refractor based upon the Pepper’s Ghost Principle
